Acme/Playwright version 0.02
============================

This module provides simple text obfuscation in the form of a 
nonsense play. This really is more for the comedy value than 
anything else. I started with the idea of doing a serious
steganography module, then decided this was too funny to pass up.
Version 0.02 is the first public release.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
